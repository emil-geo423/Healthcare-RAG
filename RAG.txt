TOOLS USED:
1. Python - Main Language
2. LangChain - used for loading PDFs, chunking text, creating retrievers, Building the RAG chain
3. HuggingFace - Text embeddings(semantic meaning)
4. Embedding Model - to convert text to vectors
5. Vector DB - Used to store vectors and find similar ones using distance metrics(L2)
             - FAISS - fast, local
             - Semantic similarity search
6. LLMs
7. Prompt Template

FAISS:
It is a vector database used in RAG system to store embeddings and perform fast semantic similarity search. 
It does not scan each vector, instead, it uses optimized indexing to quickly retrieve the most relevant 
vectors based on distance metrics like L2 or cosine similarity. This makes retrieval scalable, efficient and
suitable for large document collections
